(** [age_ntaxa_simulation p rng ~age ~ntaxa] simulates a birth death
  process of parameters [p] using random generator [rng],
  conditioned on the age of the MRCA being [age] and having [ntaxa]
  leaves.
  @raises [Invalid_arg] if the death rate is greater than the
  birth rate. The algorithm is adapted from the TESS R package, see
  function [tess.sim.taxa.age.constant], and the underlying algorithm
  is described in "Inferring Speciation and Extinction Rates under
  Different Sampling Schemes" by Sebastian HÃ¶hna et al. *)
