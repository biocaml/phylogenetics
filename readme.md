Currently implemented:
* topology tree data structure w/ branch length and indexes at leaves (including parser from post-order enumeration);
* data structures for bases, sequences and sequence tables;
* linear algebra functions (half wrappers around lacaml functions and half new functions);
* first very basic Felsenstein pruning implementation (still being debugged/improved).
